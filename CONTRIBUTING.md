# OpenHospital contribution guidelines

## Project structure

The whole project is distributed across 6 git repositories (one main/aggregation repository, and 5 sub-repositories):

- https://github.com/informatici/openhospital (this repository)
  - https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-core
  - https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-gui
  - https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-doc

## Issues

 - Jira (https://openhospital.atlassian.net/browse/OP)
 - GitHub Issues of the main repository (https://github.com/informatici/openhospital/issues)

The GitHub issues are disabled on the single components repositories,
and are only enabled on this one, with the only purpose to collect tickets (unplanned issues/bugs) and the issues about the parent repository,
while the Jira Ticketing system is meant to organise the whole project (planned issues) among all components.
