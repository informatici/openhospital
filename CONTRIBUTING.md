## Issues

 - Jira (https://openhospital.atlassian.net/browse/OP)
 - GitHub Issues of the main repository (https://github.com/informatici/openhospital/issues)

The GitHub issues are disabled on the single components repositories,
and are only enabled on this one, with the only purpose to collect tickets (unplanned issues/bugs) and the issues about the parent repository,
while the Jira Ticketing system is meant to organise the whole project (planned issues) among all components.

It is possible to use the following filter on Jira to identify the good first issues to handle: https://openhospital.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=10206
