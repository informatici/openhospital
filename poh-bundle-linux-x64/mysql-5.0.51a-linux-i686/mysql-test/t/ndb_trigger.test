# Test for bug#18437 "Wrong values inserted with a before update
# trigger on NDB table". SQL-layer didn't properly inform handler
# about fields which were read and set in triggers. In some cases 
# this resulted in incorrect (garbage) values of OLD variables and
# lost changes to NEW variables.
# You can find similar tests for ON INSERT triggers in federated.test
# since this engine so far is the only engine in MySQL which cares
# about field mark-up during handler::write_row() operation.
