# See if slave restarts the transaction after failing on an InnoDB deadlock error.

# Note: testing what happens when too many retries is possible, but
# needs large waits when running with --debug, so we don't do it.
# The same way, this test may not test what is expected when run
# under Valgrind, timings are too short then (with --valgrind I
# (Guilhem) have seen the test manage to provoke lock wait timeout
# error but not deadlock error; that is ok as code deals with the two
# errors in exactly the same way.
# We don't 'show status like 'slave_retried_transactions'' because this
# is not repeatable (depends on sleeps).
