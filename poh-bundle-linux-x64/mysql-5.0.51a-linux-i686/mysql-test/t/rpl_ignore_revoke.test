# test verifies that REVOKE must not be replicated when

###  CLEAN-UP: create an account and manually duplicate it on the slave

connection master;
grant select on *.* to 'user_foo'@'%' identified by 'user_foopass';
revoke select on *.* from 'user_foo'@'%';
select select_priv from mysql.user where user='user_foo' /* master:must be N */;

sync_slave_with_master;
#connection slave;
grant select on *.* to 'user_foo'@'%' identified by 'user_foopass';
revoke select on *.* from 'user_foo'@'%';
select select_priv from mysql.user where user='user_foo' /* slave:must be N */;


### TEST

#connection slave;
grant select on *.* to 'user_foo'@'%' identified by 'user_foopass';
select select_priv from mysql.user where user='user_foo' /* slave:must be Y */;

connection master;
revoke select on *.* from 'user_foo';
select select_priv from mysql.user where user='user_foo' /* master:must be N */;

sync_slave_with_master;
#connection slave;
select select_priv from mysql.user where user='user_foo' /* slave:must get Y */;

### CLEAN-UP

connection slave;
--disable_abort_on_error
revoke select on *.* FROM 'user_foo';
--enable_abort_on_error

connection master;
delete from mysql.user where user="user_foo";
sync_slave_with_master;

# Since changes to mysql.* are ignored, the revoke need to
# be done on slave as well
delete from mysql.user where user="user_foo";
