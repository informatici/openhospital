.SH "NAME"
mysql_zap \- kill processes that match a pattern
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 36
\fBmysql_zap [\-\fR\fB\fIsignal\fR\fR\fB] [\-?Ift] \fR\fB\fIpattern\fR\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmysql_zap\fR
kills processes that match a pattern. It uses the
\fBps\fR
command and Unix signals, so it runs on Unix and Unix\-like systems.
.PP
Invoke
\fBmysql_zap\fR
like this:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_zap [\-\fR\fB\fIsignal\fR\fR\fB] [\-?Ift] \fR\fB\fIpattern\fR\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
A process matches if its output line from the
\fBps\fR
command contains the pattern. By default,
\fBmysql_zap\fR
asks for confirmation for each process. Respond
y
to kill the process, or
q
to exit
\fBmysql_zap\fR. For any other response,
\fBmysql_zap\fR
does not attempt to kill the process.
.PP
If the
\fB\-\fR\fB\fIsignal\fR\fR
option is given, it specifies the name or number of the signal to send to each process. Otherwise,
\fBmysql_zap\fR
tries first with
TERM
(signal 15) and then with
KILL
(signal 9).
.PP
\fBmysql_zap\fR
understands the following additional options:
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-help\fR,
\fB\-?\fR,
\fB\-I\fR
.sp
Display a help message and exit.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-f\fR
.sp
Force mode.
\fBmysql_zap\fR
attempts to kill each process without confirmation.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-t\fR
.sp
Test mode. Display information about each process but do not kill it.
