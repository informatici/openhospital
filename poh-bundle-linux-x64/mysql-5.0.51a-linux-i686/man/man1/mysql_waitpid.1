.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 38
\fBmysql_waitpid [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] \fR\fB\fIpid\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIwait_time\fR\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmysql_waitpid\fR
signals a process to terminate and waits for the process to exit. It uses the
kill()
system call and Unix signals, so it runs on Unix and Unix\-like systems.
.PP
Invoke
\fBmysql_waitpid\fR
like this:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_waitpid [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] \fR\fB\fIpid\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIwait_time\fR\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
\fBmysql_waitpid\fR
sends signal 0 to the process identified by
\fIpid\fR
and waits up to
\fIwait_time\fR
seconds for the process to terminate.
\fIpid\fR
and
\fIwait_time\fR
must be positive integers.
.PP
If process termination occurs within the wait time or the process does not exist,
\fBmysql_waitpid\fR
returns 0. Otherwise, it returns 1.
.PP
If the
kill()
system call cannot handle signal 0,
\fBmysql_waitpid()\fR
uses signal 1 instead.
.PP
\fBmysql_waitpid\fR
understands the following options:
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-help\fR,
\fB\-?\fR,
\fB\-I\fR
.sp
Display a help message and exit.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-verbose\fR,
\fB\-v\fR
.sp
Verbose mode. Display a warning if signal 0 could not be used and signal 1 is used instead.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-version\fR,
\fB\-V\fR
.sp
Display version information and exit.
