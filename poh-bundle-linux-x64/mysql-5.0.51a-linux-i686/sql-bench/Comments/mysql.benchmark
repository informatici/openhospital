# This file describes how to run MySQL benchmarks with MySQL
# 

# The test was run on a Intel Xeon 2x 550 Mzh machine with 1G memory,
# 9G hard disk.  The OS is Suse 6.4, with Linux 2.2.14 compiled with SMP
# support
# Both the perl client and the database server is run
# on the same machine. No other cpu intensive process was used during
# the benchmark.

#
#
# First, install MySQL from RPM or compile it according to the
# recommendations in the MySQL manual
#

# Start MySQL

bin/safe_mysqld -O key_buffer=16M &

#
# Now we run the test that can be found in the sql-bench directory in the
# MySQL 3.23 source distribution with and without --fast
#
# Note that if you want to make a results that is comparead to some database,
# You should add "--cmp=databasename" as an extra option to the test
#
$CMP=--cmp=pg

run-all-tests --comment="Intel Xeon, 2x550 Mhz, 1G, key_buffer=16M" --fast $CMP

# If you want to store the results in a output/RUN-xxx file, you should
# repeate the benchmark with the extra option --log --use-old-result
# This will create a the RUN file based of the previous results
#
