%description
This package includes the shared libraries for MySQL %{version3},
MySQL %{version40}, %{version41} as well as MySQL %{version50}.
Install this package instead of "MySQL-shared", if you have applications
installed that are dynamically linked against older versions of the MySQL
client library but you want to upgrade to MySQL %{version} without breaking the
library dependencies.
