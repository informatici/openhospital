.SH "NAME"
mysql.server \- MySQL server startup script
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 19
\fBmysql {start|stop}\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
MySQL distributions on Unix include a script named
\fBmysql.server\fR. It can be used on systems such as Linux and Solaris that use System V\-style run directories to start and stop system services. It is also used by the Mac OS X Startup Item for MySQL.
.PP
\fBmysql.server\fR
can be found in the
\fIsupport\-files\fR
directory under your MySQL installation directory or in a MySQL source distribution.
.PP
If you use the Linux server RPM package (MySQL\-server\-\fIVERSION\fR.rpm), the
\fBmysql.server\fR
script will be installed in the
\fI/etc/init.d\fR
directory with the name
\fImysql\fR. You need not install it manually. See
Section\ 4.9, \(lqInstalling MySQL from RPM Packages on Linux\(rq, for more information on the Linux RPM packages.
.PP
Some vendors provide RPM packages that install a startup script under a different name such as
\fBmysqld\fR.
.PP
If you install MySQL from a source distribution or using a binary distribution format that does not install
\fBmysql.server\fR
automatically, you can install it manually. Instructions are provided in
Section\ 4.16.2.2, \(lqStarting and Stopping MySQL Automatically\(rq.
.PP
\fBmysql.server\fR
reads options from the
[mysql.server]
and
[mysqld]
sections of option files. For backward compatibility, it also reads
[mysql_server]
sections, although you should rename such sections to
[mysql.server]
when using MySQL 5.0.
.PP
\fBmysql.server\fR
understands the following options:
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-basedir=\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
.sp
The path to the MySQL installation directory.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-datadir=\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
.sp
The path to the MySQL data directory.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-pid\-file=\fR\fB\fIfile_name\fR\fR
.sp
The pathname of the file in which the server should write its process ID.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-service\-startup\-timeout=\fR\fB\fIfile_name\fR\fR
.sp
How long in seconds to wait for confirmation of server startup. If the server does not start within this time,
\fBmysql.server\fR
exits with an error. The default value is 900. A value of 0 means not to wait at all for startup. Negative values mean to wait forever (no timeout). This option was added in MySQL 5.0.40. Before that, a value of 900 is always used.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-use\-mysqld_safe\fR
.sp
Use
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
to start the server. This is the default. This option was added in MySQL 5.0.4.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-use\-manager\fR
.sp
Use Instance Manager to start the server. This option was added in MySQL 5.0.4.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-user=\fR\fB\fIuser_name\fR\fR
.sp
The login username to use for running
\fBmysqld\fR. This option was added in MySQL 5.0.4.
