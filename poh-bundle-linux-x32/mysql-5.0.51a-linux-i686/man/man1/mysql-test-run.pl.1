\fBmysql\-test\-run.pl [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBmysql\-test\-run.pl\fR
Perl script is the main application used to run the MySQL test suite. It invokes
\fBmysqltest\fR
to run individual test cases. (Prior to MySQL 4.1, a similar shell script,
\fBmysql\-test\-run\fR, can be used instead.)
.PP
Invoke
\fBmysql\-test\-run.pl\fR
in the
\fImysql\-test\fR
directory like this:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql\-test\-run.pl [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] [\fR\fB\fItest_name\fR\fR\fB] ...\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
Each
\fItest_name\fR
argument names a test case. The test case file that corresponds to the test name is
\fIt/\fR\fI\fItest_name\fR\fR\fI.test\fR.
.PP
For each
\fItest_name\fR
argument,
\fBmysql\-test\-run.pl\fR
runs the named test case. With no
\fItest_name\fR
arguments,
\fBmysql\-test\-run.pl\fR
runs all
\fI.test\fR
files in the
\fIt\fR
subdirectory.
.PP
If no suffix is given for the test name, a suffix of
\fI.test\fR
is assumed. Any leading pathname is ignored. These commands are equivalent:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql\-test\-run.pl mytest\fR
shell> \fBmysql\-test\-run.pl mytest.test\fR
shell> \fBmysql\-test\-run.pl t/mytest.test\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
As of MySQL 5.1.23, a suite name can be given as part of the test name. That is, the syntax for naming a test is:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
[\fIsuite_name\fR.]\fItest_name\fR[.\fIsuffix\fR]
.fi
.RE
.PP
If a suite name is given,
\fBmysql\-test\-run.pl\fR
looks in that suite for the test. With no suite name,
\fBmysql\-test\-run.pl\fR
looks in the default list of suites for a match and runs the test in any suites where it finds the test. Suppose that the default suite list is
main,
binlog,
rpl, and that a test
\fImytest.test\fR
exists in the
main
and
rpl
suites. With an argument of
mytest
or
mytest.test,
\fBmysql\-test\-run.pl\fR
will run
\fImytest.test\fR
from the
main
and
rpl
suites.
.PP
To run a family of test cases for which the names share a common prefix, use the
\fB\-\-do\-test=\fR\fB\fIprefix\fR\fR
option. For example,
\fB\-\-do\-test=rpl\fR
runs the replication tests (test cases that have names beginning with
rpl).
.PP
To perform setup prior to running tests,
\fBmysql\-test\-run.pl\fR
needs to invoke
\fBmysqld\fR
with the
\fB\-\-bootstrap\fR
and
\fB\-\-skip\-grant\-tables\fR
options (see
[1]\&\fITypical \fBconfigure\fR Options\fR). If MySQL was configured with the
\fB\-\-disable\-grant\-options\fR
option,
\fB\-\-bootstrap\fR,
\fB\-\-skip\-grant\-tables\fR, and
\fB\-\-init\-file\fR
will be disabled. To handle this, set the
MYSQLD_BOOTSTRAP
environment variable to the full pathname of a server that has all options enabled.
\fBmysql\-test\-run.pl\fR
will use that server to perform setup; it is not used to run the tests.
.PP
The
init_file
test will fail if
\fB\-\-init\-file\fR
is disabled. This is an expected failure that can be handled as follows:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBexport MYSQLD_BOOTSTRAP\fR
shell> \fBMYSQLD_BOOTSTRAP=/full/path/to/mysqld\fR
shell> \fBmake test force="\-\-skip\-test=init_file"\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
To run
\fBmysql\-test\-run.pl\fR
on Windows, you'll need either Cygwin or ActiveState Perl to run it. You may also need to install the modules required by the script. To run the test script, change location into the
\fImysql\-test\fR
directory, set the
MTR_VS_CONFIG
environment variable to the configuration you selected earlier (or use the
\fB\-\-vs\-config\fR
option), and invoke
\fBmysql\-test\-run.pl\fR. For example (using Cygwin and the
\fBbash\fR
shell):
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBcd mysql\-test\fR
shell> \fBexport MTS_VS_CONFIG=debug\fR
shell> \fB./mysqltest\-run.pl \-\-force \-\-timer\fR
shell> \fB./mysqltest\-run.pl \-\-force \-\-timer \-\-ps\-protocol\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
If you have a copy of
\fBmysqld\fR
running on the machine where you want to run the test suite, you do not have to stop it, as long as it is not using ports
9306
or
9307. If either of those ports is taken, you should set the
MTR_BUILD_THREAD
environment variable to an appropriate value, and the test suite will use a different set of ports for master, slave, NDB, and Instance Manager). For example:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBexport MTR_BUILD_THREAD=31\fR
shell> \fB./mysql\-test\-run.pl [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] [\fR\fB\fItest_name\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
\fBmysql\-test\-run.pl\fR
defines several environment variables. Some of them are listed in the following table.
.TS

.PP
Tests sometimes rely on certain environment variables being defined. For example, certain tests assume that
MYSQL_TEST
is defined so that
\fBmysqltest\fR
can invoke itself with
exec $MYSQL_TEST.
.PP
\fBmysql\-test\-run.pl\fR
supports the options in the following list. An argument of
\fB\-\-\fR
tells
\fBmysql\-test\-run.pl\fR
not to process any following arguments as options. (A description of differences between the options supported by
\fBmysql\-test\-run.pl\fR
and
\fBmysql\-test\-run\fR
appears following the list.)

\fI/dev/shm\fR. You can also enable this option by setting the environment variable
MTR_MEM[=\fIdir_name\fR]. If
