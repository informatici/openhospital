.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
is the recommended way to start a
\fBmysqld\fR
server on Unix and NetWare.
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
adds some safety features such as restarting the server when an error occurs and logging runtime information to an error log file. NetWare\-specific behaviors are listed later in this section.

\fBNote\fR
.PP
To preserve backward compatibility with older versions of MySQL, MySQL binary distributions still include
\fBsafe_mysqld\fR
as a symbolic link to
\fBmysqld_safe\fR. However, you should not rely on this because it is removed as of MySQL 5.1.
.PP
By default,
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
before MySQL 5.0.27 tries to start an executable named
\fBmysqld\-max\fR
if it exists, and
\fBmysqld\fR
otherwise. Be aware of the implications of this behavior:
.TP 3n
\(bu
On Linux, the
MySQL\-Max
RPM relies on this
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
behavior. The RPM installs an executable named
\fBmysqld\-max\fR, which causes
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
to automatically use that executable rather than
\fBmysqld\fR
from that point on.
.TP 3n
\(bu
If you install a MySQL\-Max distribution that includes a server named
\fBmysqld\-max\fR, and then upgrade later to a non\-Max version of MySQL,
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
will still attempt to run the old
\fBmysqld\-max\fR
server. If you perform such an upgrade, you should manually remove the old
\fBmysqld\-max\fR
server to ensure that
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
runs the new
\fBmysqld\fR
server.
.sp
.RE
.PP
To override the default behavior and specify explicitly the name of the server you want to run, specify a
\fB\-\-mysqld\fR
or
\fB\-\-mysqld\-version\fR
option to
\fBmysqld_safe\fR. You can also use
\fB\-\-ledir\fR
to indicate the directory where
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
should look for the server.
.PP
Many of the options to
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
are the same as the options to
\fBmysqld\fR. See
Section\ 1.2, \(lqCommand Options\(rq.
.PP
All options specified to
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
on the command line are passed to
\fBmysqld\fR. If you want to use any options that are specific to
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
and that
\fBmysqld\fR
doesn't support, do not specify them on the command line. Instead, list them in the
[mysqld_safe]
group of an option file. See
Section\ 2.2.2, \(lqUsing Option Files\(rq.
.PP
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
reads all options from the
[mysqld],
[server], and
[mysqld_safe]
sections in option files. For example, if you specify a
[mysqld]
section like this,
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
will find and use the
\fB\-\-log\-error\fR
option:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
[mysqld]
log\-error=error.log
.fi
.RE
.PP
For backward compatibility,
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
also reads
[safe_mysqld]
sections, although you should rename such sections to
[mysqld_safe]
in MySQL 5.0 installations.
.PP
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
supports the following options:

(NetWare only) On NetWare,
\fBmysqld_safe\fR

The name of the server program (in the

\fBmysqld_safe\fR
cannot find the server, use the

This option is similar to the
\fB\-\-mysqld\fR
option, but you specify only the suffix for the server program name. The basename is assumed to be
\fBmysqld\fR. For example, if you use
\fB\-\-mysqld\-version=debug\fR,
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
starts the
\fBmysqld\-debug\fR
program in the
ledir

\fBmysqld_safe\fR
uses
\fBmysqld\fR

If you execute
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
with the
\fB\-\-defaults\-file\fR
or
\fB\-\-defaults\-extra\-option\fR
option to name an option file, the option must be the first one given on the command line or the option file will not be used. For example, this command will not use the named option file:
.sp
.RS 3n

.RE
.PP
The
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
script is written so that it normally can start a server that was installed from either a source or a binary distribution of MySQL, even though these types of distributions typically install the server in slightly different locations. (See
Section\ 4.6, \(lqInstallation Layouts\(rq.)
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
expects one of the following conditions to be true:
.TP 3n
\(bu
The server and databases can be found relative to the working directory (the directory from which
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
is invoked). For binary distributions,
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
looks under its working directory for
\fIbin\fR
and
\fIdata\fR
directories. For source distributions, it looks for
\fIlibexec\fR
and
\fIvar\fR
directories. This condition should be met if you execute
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
from your MySQL installation directory (for example,
\fI/usr/local/mysql\fR
for a binary distribution).
.TP 3n
\(bu
If the server and databases cannot be found relative to the working directory,
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
attempts to locate them by absolute pathnames. Typical locations are
\fI/usr/local/libexec\fR
and
\fI/usr/local/var\fR. The actual locations are determined from the values configured into the distribution at the time it was built. They should be correct if MySQL is installed in the location specified at configuration time.
.sp
.RE
.PP
Because
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
tries to find the server and databases relative to its own working directory, you can install a binary distribution of MySQL anywhere, as long as you run
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
from the MySQL installation directory:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBcd \fR\fB\fImysql_installation_directory\fR\fR
shell> \fBbin/mysqld_safe &\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
If
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
fails, even when invoked from the MySQL installation directory, you can specify the
\fB\-\-ledir\fR
and
\fB\-\-datadir\fR
options to indicate the directories in which the server and databases are located on your system.
.PP
Normally, you should not edit the
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
script. Instead, configure
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
by using command\-line options or options in the
[mysqld_safe]
section of a
\fImy.cnf\fR
option file. In rare cases, it might be necessary to edit
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
to get it to start the server properly. However, if you do this, your modified version of
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
might be overwritten if you upgrade MySQL in the future, so you should make a copy of your edited version that you can reinstall.
.PP
On NetWare,
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
is a NetWare Loadable Module (NLM) that is ported from the original Unix shell script. It starts the server as follows:
.TP 3n
1.
Runs a number of system and option checks.
.TP 3n
2.
Runs a check on
MyISAM
tables.
.TP 3n
3.
Provides a screen presence for the MySQL server.
.TP 3n
4.
Starts
\fBmysqld\fR, monitors it, and restarts it if it terminates in error.
.TP 3n
5.
Sends error messages from
\fBmysqld\fR
to the
\fI\fIhost_name\fR\fR\fI.err\fR
file in the data directory.
.TP 3n
6.
Sends
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
screen output to the
\fI\fIhost_name\fR\fR\fI.safe\fR
file in the data directory.
