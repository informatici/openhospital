\fBmyisam_ftdump [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] \fR\fB\fItbl_name\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIindex_num\fR\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmyisam_ftdump\fR
displays information about
FULLTEXT
indexes in
MyISAM
tables. It reads the
MyISAM
index file directly, so it must be run on the server host where the table is located
.PP
Invoke
\fBmyisam_ftdump\fR
like this:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmyisam_ftdump [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] \fR\fB\fItbl_name\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIindex_num\fR\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
The
\fItbl_name\fR
argument should be the name of a
MyISAM
table. You can also specify a table by naming its index file (the file with the
\fI.MYI\fR
suffix). If you do not invoke
\fBmyisam_ftdump\fR
in the directory where the table files are located, the table or index file name must be preceded by the pathname to the table's database directory. Index numbers begin with 0.
.PP
Example: Suppose that the
test
database contains a table named
mytexttablel
that has the following definition:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
CREATE TABLE mytexttable
(
  id   INT NOT NULL,
  txt  TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FULLTEXT (txt)
);
.fi
.RE
.PP
The index on
id
is index 0 and the
FULLTEXT
index on
txt
is index 1. If your working directory is the
test
database directory, invoke
\fBmyisam_ftdump\fR
as follows:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmyisam_ftdump mytexttable 1\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
If the pathname to the
test
database directory is
\fI/usr/local/mysql/data/test\fR, you can also specify the table name argument using that pathname. This is useful if you do not invoke
\fBmyisam_ftdump\fR
in the database directory:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmyisam_ftdump /usr/local/mysql/data/test/mytexttable 1\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
\fBmyisam_ftdump\fR
understands the following options:
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-help\fR,
\fB\-h\fR
\fB\-?\fR
.sp
Display a help message and exit.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-count\fR,
\fB\-c\fR
.sp
Calculate per\-word statistics (counts and global weights).
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-dump\fR,
\fB\-d\fR
.sp
Dump the index, including data offsets and word weights.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-length\fR,
\fB\-l\fR
.sp
Report the length distribution.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-stats\fR,
\fB\-s\fR
.sp
Report global index statistics. This is the default operation if no other operation is specified.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-verbose\fR,
\fB\-v\fR
.sp
Verbose mode. Print more output about what the program does.
