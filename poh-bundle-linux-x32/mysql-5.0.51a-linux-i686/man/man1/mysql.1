.HP 24
\fBmysql [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] \fR\fB\fIdb_name\fR\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmysql\fR
is a simple SQL shell (with GNU
readline
capabilities). It supports interactive and non\-interactive use. When used interactively, query results are presented in an ASCII\-table format. When used non\-interactively (for example, as a filter), the result is presented in tab\-separated format. The output format can be changed using command options.
.PP
If you have problems due to insufficient memory for large result sets, use the
\fB\-\-quick\fR
option. This forces
\fBmysql\fR
to retrieve results from the server a row at a time rather than retrieving the entire result set and buffering it in memory before displaying it. This is done by returning the result set using the
mysql_use_result()
C API function in the client/server library rather than
mysql_store_result().
.PP
Using
\fBmysql\fR
is very easy. Invoke it from the prompt of your command interpreter as follows:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql \fR\fB\fIdb_name\fR\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
Or:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql \-\-user=\fR\fB\fIuser_name\fR\fR\fB \-\-password=\fR\fB\fIyour_password\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIdb_name\fR\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
Then type an SQL statement, end it with
\(lq;\(rq,
\\g, or
\\G
and press Enter.
.PP
As of MySQL 5.0.25, typing Control\-C causes
\fBmysql\fR
to attempt to kill the current statement. If this cannot be done, or Control\-C is typed again before the statement is killed,
\fBmysql\fR
exits. Previously, Control\-C caused
\fBmysql\fR
to exit in all cases.
.PP
You can execute SQL statements in a script file (batch file) like this:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql \fR\fB\fIdb_name\fR\fR\fB < \fR\fB\fIscript.sql\fR\fR\fB > \fR\fB\fIoutput.tab\fR\fR
.fi

If you provide an argument to the
help

the section called \(lq\fBMYSQL\fR SERVER\-SIDE HELP\(rq.
.PP
The
charset
command changes the default character set and issues a
SET NAMES
statement. This enables the character set to remain synchronized on the client and server if
\fBmysql\fR
is run with auto\-reconnect enabled (which is not recommended), because the changed character set is used for reconnects. This command was added in MySQL 5.0.25.

To log queries and their output, use the
\fBtee\fR
command. All the data displayed on the screen is appended into a given file. This can be very useful for debugging purposes also. You can enable this feature on the command line with the
\fB\-\-tee\fR
option, or interactively with the
\fBtee\fR
command. The
\fBtee\fR
file can be disabled interactively with the
\fBnotee\fR
command. Executing
\fBtee\fR
again re\-enables logging. Without a parameter, the previous file is used. Note that
\fBtee\fR
flushes query results to the file after each statement, just before
\fBmysql\fR
prints its next prompt.
.PP
By using the
\fB\-\-pager\fR
option, it is possible to browse or search query results in interactive mode with Unix programs such as
\fBless\fR,
\fBmore\fR, or any other similar program. If you specify no value for the option,
\fBmysql\fR
checks the value of the
PAGER
environment variable and sets the pager to that. Output paging can be enabled interactively with the
\fBpager\fR
command and disabled with
\fBnopager\fR. The command takes an optional argument; if given, the paging program is set to that. With no argument, the pager is set to the pager that was set on the command line, or
stdout
if no pager was specified.
.PP
Output paging works only in Unix because it uses the
popen()
function, which does not exist on Windows. For Windows, the
\fBtee\fR
option can be used instead to save query output, although this is not as convenient as
\fBpager\fR
for browsing output in some situations.
.PP
Here are a few tips about the
\fBpager\fR
command:
.TP 3n
\(bu
You can use it to write to a file and the results go only to the file:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
mysql> \fBpager cat > /tmp/log.txt\fR
.fi
.RE
You can also pass any options for the program that you want to use as your pager:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
mysql> \fBpager less \-n \-i \-S\fR
.fi
.RE
.TP 3n
\(bu
In the preceding example, note the
\fB\-S\fR
option. You may find it very useful for browsing wide query results. Sometimes a very wide result set is difficult to read on the screen. The
\fB\-S\fR
option to
\fBless\fR
can make the result set much more readable because you can scroll it horizontally using the left\-arrow and right\-arrow keys. You can also use
\fB\-S\fR
interactively within
\fBless\fR
to switch the horizontal\-browse mode on and off. For more information, read the
\fBless\fR
manual page:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBman less\fR
.fi
.RE
.TP 3n
\(bu
You can specify very complex pager commands for handling query output:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
mysql> \fBpager cat | tee /dr1/tmp/res.txt \\\fR
          \fB| tee /dr2/tmp/res2.txt | less \-n \-i \-S\fR
.fi
.RE
In this example, the command would send query results to two files in two different directories on two different filesystems mounted on
\fI/dr1\fR
and
\fI/dr2\fR, yet still display the results onscreen via
\fBless\fR.
.sp
.RE
.PP
You can also combine the
\fBtee\fR
and
\fBpager\fR
functions. Have a
\fBtee\fR
file enabled and
\fBpager\fR
set to
\fBless\fR, and you are able to browse the results using the
\fBless\fR
program and still have everything appended into a file the same time. The difference between the Unix
\fBtee\fR
used with the
\fBpager\fR
command and the
\fBmysql\fR
built\-in
\fBtee\fR
command is that the built\-in
\fBtee\fR
works even if you do not have the Unix
\fBtee\fR
available. The built\-in
\fBtee\fR
also logs everything that is printed on the screen, whereas the Unix
\fBtee\fR
used with
\fBpager\fR
does not log quite that much. Additionally,
\fBtee\fR
file logging can be turned on and off interactively from within
\fBmysql\fR. This is useful when you want to log some queries to a file, but not others.

.SH "EXECUTING SQL STATEMENTS FROM A TEXT FILE"

The
\fBmysql\fR
client typically is used interactively, like this:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql \fR\fB\fIdb_name\fR\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
However, it is also possible to put your SQL statements in a file and then tell
\fBmysql\fR
to read its input from that file. To do so, create a text file
\fItext_file\fR
that contains the statements you wish to execute. Then invoke
\fBmysql\fR
as shown here:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql \fR\fB\fIdb_name\fR\fR\fB < \fR\fB\fItext_file\fR\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
If you place a
USE \fIdb_name\fR
statement as the first statement in the file, it is unnecessary to specify the database name on the command line:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql < text_file\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
If you are already running
\fBmysql\fR, you can execute an SQL script file using the
source
command or
\\.
command:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
mysql> \fBsource \fR\fB\fIfile_name\fR\fR
mysql> \fB\\. \fR\fB\fIfile_name\fR\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
Sometimes you may want your script to display progress information to the user. For this you can insert statements like this:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
SELECT '<info_to_display>' AS ' ';
.fi
.RE
.PP
The statement shown outputs
<info_to_display>.
.PP
As of MySQL 5.0.54,
\fBmysql\fR
ignores Unicode byte order mark (BOM) characters at the beginning of input files. Previously, it read them and sent them to the server, resulting in a syntax error. Presence of a BOM does not cause
\fBmysql\fR
to change its default character set. To do that, invoke
\fBmysql\fR
with an option such as
\fB\-\-default\-character\-set=utf8\fR.

This section describes some techniques that can help you use
\fBmysql\fR
more effectively.
.SS "Displaying Query Results Vertically"
.PP
Some query results are much more readable when displayed vertically, instead of in the usual horizontal table format. Queries can be displayed vertically by terminating the query with \\G instead of a semicolon. For example, longer text values that include newlines often are much easier to read with vertical output:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
mysql> \fBSELECT * FROM mails WHERE LENGTH(txt) < 300 LIMIT 300,1\\G\fR

.SS "Using the \-\-safe\-updates Option"
.PP
For beginners, a useful startup option is
\fB\-\-safe\-updates\fR
(or
\fB\-\-i\-am\-a\-dummy\fR, which has the same effect). It is helpful for cases when you might have issued a
DELETE FROM \fItbl_name\fR
statement but forgotten the
WHERE
clause. Normally, such a statement deletes all rows from the table. With
\fB\-\-safe\-updates\fR, you can delete rows only by specifying the key values that identify them. This helps prevent accidents.
.PP
When you use the
\fB\-\-safe\-updates\fR
option,
\fBmysql\fR
issues the following statement when it connects to the MySQL server:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=1,SQL_SELECT_LIMIT=1000, SQL_MAX_JOIN_SIZE=1000000;
.fi
.RE
.PP
See
Section\ 5.3, \(lqSET Syntax\(rq.
.PP
The
SET
statement has the following effects:
.TP 3n
\(bu
You are not allowed to execute an
UPDATE
or
DELETE
statement unless you specify a key constraint in the
WHERE
clause or provide a
LIMIT
clause (or both). For example:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
UPDATE \fItbl_name\fR SET \fInot_key_column\fR=\fIval\fR WHERE \fIkey_column\fR=\fIval\fR;
UPDATE \fItbl_name\fR SET \fInot_key_column\fR=\fIval\fR LIMIT 1;
.fi
.RE
.TP 3n
\(bu
The server limits all large
SELECT
results to 1,000 rows unless the statement includes a
LIMIT
clause.
.TP 3n
\(bu
The server aborts multiple\-table
SELECT
statements that probably need to examine more than 1,000,000 row combinations.
.sp
.RE
.PP
To specify limits different from 1,000 and 1,000,000, you can override the defaults by using the
\fB\-\-select_limit\fR
and
\fB\-\-max_join_size\fR
options:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql \-\-safe\-updates \-\-select_limit=500 \-\-max_join_size=10000\fR
.fi

.SS "Disabling mysql Auto\-Reconnect"
.PP
If the
\fBmysql\fR
client loses its connection to the server while sending a statement, it immediately and automatically tries to reconnect once to the server and send the statement again. However, even if
\fBmysql\fR
succeeds in reconnecting, your first connection has ended and all your previous session objects and settings are lost: temporary tables, the autocommit mode, and user\-defined and session variables. Also, any current transaction rolls back. This behavior may be dangerous for you, as in the following example where the server was shut down and restarted between the first and second statements without you knowing it:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
mysql> \fBSET @a=1;\fR
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)
mysql> \fBINSERT INTO t VALUES(@a);\fR
ERROR 2006: MySQL server has gone away
No connection. Trying to reconnect...
Connection id:    1
Current database: test
Query OK, 1 row affected (1.30 sec)
mysql> \fBSELECT * FROM t;\fR
+\-\-\-\-\-\-+
| a    |
+\-\-\-\-\-\-+
| NULL |
+\-\-\-\-\-\-+
1 row in set (0.05 sec)
.fi
.RE
.PP
The
@a
user variable has been lost with the connection, and after the reconnection it is undefined. If it is important to have
\fBmysql\fR
terminate with an error if the connection has been lost, you can start the
\fBmysql\fR
client with the
\fB\-\-skip\-reconnect\fR
option.
.PP
For more information about auto\-reconnect and its effect on state information when a reconnection occurs, see
Section\ 2.13, \(lqControlling Automatic Reconnect Behavior\(rq.
