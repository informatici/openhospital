.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmysql_fix_extensions\fR
converts the extensions for
MyISAM
(or
ISAM) table files to their canonical forms. It looks for files with extensions matching any lettercase variant of
\fI.frm\fR,
\fI.myd\fR,
\fI.myi\fR,
\fI.isd\fR, and
\fI.ism\fR
and renames them to have extensions of
\fI.frm\fR,
\fI.MYD\fR,
\fI.MYI\fR,
\fI.ISD\fR, and
\fI.ISM\fR, respectively. This can be useful after transferring the files from a system with case\-insensitive filenames (such as Windows) to a system with case\-sensitive filenames.
.PP
Invoke
\fBmysql_fix_extensions\fR
like this, where
\fIdata_dir\fR
is the pathname to the MySQL data directory.
