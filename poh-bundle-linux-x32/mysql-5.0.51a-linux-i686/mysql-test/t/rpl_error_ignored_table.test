# Test for 
# Bug #797: If a query is ignored on slave (replicate-ignore-table) the slave
# still checks that it has the same error as on the master.

# generate an error that goes to the binlog

# as the t1 table is ignored on the slave, the slave should be able to sync

# Do-compile, hence we have to replace the port number here accordingly

# Now test that even critical errors (connection killed)
