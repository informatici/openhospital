### Test 1:
### - While a consistent snapshot transaction is executed,
###   no external inserts should be visible to the transaction.

connection con1;
create table t1 (a int) engine=innodb;
start transaction with consistent snapshot;

connection con2;
insert into t1 values(1);

connection con1;
select * from t1; # if consistent snapshot was set as expected, we
# should see nothing.
commit;

### Test 2:
### - For any non-consistent snapshot transaction, external
###   committed inserts should be visible to the transaction.

delete from t1;
start transaction; # Now we omit WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT

connection con2;
insert into t1 values(1);

connection con1;
select * from t1; # if consistent snapshot was not set, as expected, we
# should see 1.
commit;

drop table t1;

# End of 4.1 tests
