## Software

Open Hospital (OH) is deployed as a desktop application that can be used in a standalone, single user mode (PORTABLE mode)
or in a client / server network configuration (CLIENT mode), where multiple clients and users connect to the same database server.
OH is developed in Java and it is based on open-source tools and libraries; it runs on any computer, requires low resources and is designed to work without an internet connection.
For more information check the online documentation [here][documentation].

Open Hospital is composed by the following components, hosted in separated repositories:

 - [OH Core][core], a library that contains the business logic and the data abstraction layer
 - [OH GUI][gui], which provides a graphical user interface (GUI) made with Java Swing
 - [OH Doc][doc], which contains the user and admin documentation in Asciidoc format
 - [OH API][api], a web server that exposes REST APIs over the Core component, and it's used by the UI component [*WIP*]. 
 - [OH UI][ui], a web user interface that consists of a React SPA (single page application) [*WIP*]

## How to create OH packages

<details><summary>:construction_worker: :package:</summary>
To create the Open Hospital packages,
make sure to have installed the following dependencies on a Linux machine:
JDK 8+, Maven, asciidoctor-pdf, zip, GNU make.

Then follow these simple steps:

 1. Clone this repository:

        git clone https://github.com/informatici/openhospital

 2. Run the script that compiles the components of Open Hospital, and assembles the portable distributions:

        cd openhospital
        make
    
    You can also parallelize some make tasks by using the `-j` flag (e.g. `make -j4`)
    or use intermediate targets to build single parts of the distribution -
    use `make help` to see a list of available targets.
