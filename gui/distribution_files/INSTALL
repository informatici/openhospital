1)  unzip or/and untar OpenHospital_xxxx.tar.gz or OpenHospital_xxxx.zip to a normal user folder.
2)  Database configuration:
	go to the directory /OpenHospital/mysql/db
	edit the script create_user.sql if you want to change the user name and passwd for the user that owns the database
	edit the script create_structure.sql if you want to change the name of the database (actually "angal")
	open a console and log in mysql server with root permisions
	run the scripts (i.e. source create_user.sql and source create_all.sql)
	restore the backup available in mysql/backup
3)  Connection configuration:
	go to the directory /OpenHospital/bin/rsc
	edit the file database.properties and change the appropriate settings consistently with the one's in point 2)
	(i.e. jdbc.server,jdbc.db,jdbc.username,jdbc.password)
4)  Startup configuration:
	4.1)  	For Linux users: 
		edit the shell script /OpenHospital/bin/startup.sh and change the initial part of the last line 
		i.e. "/opt/java/jdk1.5.0_03/bin/java" with the java virtual machine invocation that fits 
		your system
	4.2) 	For Windows users:
		you need a proper .bat script for launching the java virtual machine and setting the appropriate
		CLASSPATH; we haven't yet written such a script but we will soon
		alternatively you can get a windows (i.e. .exe fiel) launcher using the program JSmooth (free software)
The CLASSPATH should include the jars in lib/, the oh.jar and the bundle/ directory which contains the language bundles.
5)  Launch the program
