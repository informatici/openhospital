User’s Guide

== OpenHospital

== 1 Abstract

This application is the first of a set of software products that ISFfootnote:[Informatici Senza Frontiere = Computer scientists without frontiers] has developed to support the management and the activities of the St. Luke Hospital in Angal (Uganda). After that mission, the St. Luke Hospital has become only the first one of a long list of hospitals that found this software useful.

All the work was realized as an open-sourcefootnote:[Open-source = software for which the original *source code* is made available to anyone free of charge.] project using only open-source development software.

This application software consists of the following parts:

* Pharmacy management
* Laboratory management
* OPD management
* Patient admission and discharge management
* Pregnancy management
* Malnutrition control management
* Vaccines database
* Patient billing support
* Therapy management
* Internal communication
* Statistics and printing

This document describes how all the above-mentioned items work and gives you some suggestions on the correct use of the program.

The reader will not find in this manual the information he needs for the installation of the application software or for administrative purposes; to have such information you should consult our Administrator’s Guide, supplied with the application software.

== 2 Introduction

The aim of this program is to manage, in the simplest manner, the hospital administrative operations like registering patients and laboratory analysis, and to produce statistics for the health ministry. In the following chapters the users will find all the information they need in order to use properly the program.

== 3 Useful Information before reading this user manual.

=== 3.1 Help

* The *[.underline]##H##ELP* function available on the bottom of the main MENU of OpenHospital allows you to access [.underline]#offline# this document.

=== 3.2 Legenda

In this document will be used following conventions:

* When in the text of this document you find a word written in bold and highlighted in grey *–* like *[.underline]##P##harmacy* or *[.underline]##N##ew –* it indicates a function of the application and it is also called “button”. *[.underline]##P##harmacy* is a button.

* When you find a text written in bold Italic (as an example *_Laboratory browsing)_* it indicates the screen with name “Laboratory browsing” (see example below). Each screen of the application is called window. *_Laboratory browsing_* is a window.
* When you find a text written in bold as - *Search patient visits –* it indicates a function of the application, or an area of the window (as an example *Data table*).

* Each button has always one letter with an underscore. You can select the functionality offered by the button pressing the “Alt” key and at the same time the “underscored” key (in the example of *[.underline]##P##harmacy* you have to press “Alt” and “P”)*.* This behaviour is common all over the application and allows the user to operate (almost) without the use of the mouse. In the entire document “Alt” key and the “P” key will be indicated as “Alt + P”.

image:extracted-media/media/image2.png[../../Screen%20Shot%202019-07-26%20at%2015.14.49.png,width=599,height=434]

* Each screen of the application is called “window”. Most complex windows of the application are composed by more than one area. Areas can be *Selection panel*, *Data table* and *Buttons panel* (see *_Laboratory browsing_* window below)

image:extracted-media/media/image3.png[../../Screen%20Shot%202019-07-26%20at%2015.15.43.png,width=642,height=464]

* Highlight of a record. To highlight a record (it is a line on a *Data table*) you have to click with the mouse on the record. The record (all the line) will be highlighted in blue. This is valid all over the application (see example below):

image:extracted-media/media/image4.png[../../Screen%20Shot%202019-07-26%20at%2015.16.05.png,width=509,height=296]

==  4 Run the application

After double-clicking the program icon on your desktop, you will see an information image (splash image) for a few seconds and then the main _menu_ of the OpenHospital application will appear.

image:extracted-media/media/image5.png[image,width=192,height=390]

From a menu you can get to another menu of deeper level, as in the example below. From the main *_menu_* you get the *_General data_* menu, or you can directly go in a function of the application (see the following example with the browser *_OPD Out Patient Department_*.

== 5 Outpatient Department Management ([.underline]##O##PD)

=== 5.1 Main Characteristics

Out Patient Department functionalities allow to record Ambulatory Patient visits, search, review, edit and eventually delete visits, and allows queries necessary for statistical purposes.

Click on *[.underline]##O##PD* button or press “Alt + O” in the main *_menu_* to access OPD function.

image:extracted-media/media/image8.png[../../Screen%20Shot%202019-07-26%20at%2015.21.09.png,width=492,height=429]

=== 5.2 Functions of Out Patient Department

All functions available under *[.underline]##O##PD* are accessible from the window *_OPD Out Patient Department_* showed below.

image:extracted-media/media/image9.png[image,width=642,height=256]

The following functions are available from the *Buttons Panel* of the window *_OPD Out Patient Department_:*

* *[.underline]##N##ew* to create a new patient visit
* *[.underline]##E##dit* to modify an already stored patient visit
* *[.underline]##D##elete* to delete a patient visit
* *[.underline]##C##lose* to exit from the function *_OPD Out Patient Department_*

Furthermore, a search function (*[.underline]##S##earch*) is available using the *Selection Panel* on the left of the window.

==== 5.2.1 Search patient visits ([.underline]##S##earch)

Queries about Ambulatory Patient Visits can be done using the search criteria available on the *Selection Panel* area of the window (left side of the window).

Doing the selection, data about patients can be selected by choosing specific fields among the following ones:

* *Disease type.* You can select one or all disease types
* *Disease.* You can select one or all the diseases
* **Date. “**DATE From” and “DATE To” allow the selection of all the visits performed over the requested period
* **Age. “**Age From” and “Age To” allow the selection of all the patients by age
* *Sex.* Allow the selection of all the patients by sex: All / Male / Female
* *Type of patient.* Allow the selection of all the visits by attendance: All / New / Re-Attendance
* *Count.* Counter at the bottom counts for you how many visits match your criteria after pressing the *[.underline]##S##earch* button.

After having chosen press *[.underline]##S##earch* button. The system will show on the *Data table* area results of the search applying criteria requested by you.

In the example hereinafter all the visits of patients with Asthma disease admitted in the period from 2006-11-01 until 2006-11-15 of all the ages, all sex, all patient types are showed.

image:extracted-media/media/image10.png[image,width=642,height=337]

==== 5.2.2 Create a new patient visit ([.underline]##N##ew)

Press *[.underline]##N##ew* button in the *_OPD Out Patient Department_* window to access the *_New OPD registration_* window showed below.

image:extracted-media/media/image11.png[image,width=391,height=435]

To record a visit, enter the following fields:

* *Type of attendance.* This field is not meant to distinguish whether an individual is new or not in the ambulatory (absolutely first time he/she enters the ambulatory). The NEW ATTENDANCE is devoted to cases when Patient (at his first or n-th time in the ambulatory it does not care here) comes to the Ambulatory to report a new health issue / new disease for which no care has already been addressed and recorded. The re-attendance is – on the contrary – the case of records created when a Patient comes back to the Ambulatory in order to follow-up a past new attendance when he/she received cares and previous instructions to recover. _ +
 +
Example: a Patient comes to the ambulatory because he/she reports a cut ==> this event is recorded as NEW ATTENDANCE and Doctor sutures the wound and invites Patient to come back ten days later; then same patient comes back after ten days to have his/her stitches removed: a new OPD record is then created but with no NEW ATTENDANCE flag set. +
_
* *Date of the visit*. Date in which Patient is met for recorded activity.
* *Disease Type:* By selecting a _DiseaseType_ the first diagnosis list will contain only its related diseases. Second and third list will still contain all diseases. +
 +
_*[.underline]#NB#*: Disease Types can be defined by the Administrator._ _Ask to your Administrator how to do it or see link:#14-general-data-general-data[General Data] in this document. +
_
* *Diagnosis.* Maximum three diseases can be diagnosed per each attendance (“new attendance” or “re-attendance” it does not care in this context). Normally patient reports at least one visit reason but it may happen that during same visit the Doctor finds other concurrent pathologies thus here possibility is given to record till maximum three (the first being the only one mandatory). +
It is possible to filter in order to find diseases more easily. To do so, you will need to enter a text fragment in the search field that is part of the disease name. The closer the search text comes to the name of the disease being searched, the more precise the search is. +
 +
_*[.underline]#NB#*: in the *OPD Out Patient Department* window only first diagnosis and its type will be show, anyway all data are stored and processed in reports and searching._
* *Patient age*. Validity range is 0-200.
* *Patient sex*. Male/female

When you finish entering data in the *Buttons Panel* you have the following choices:

* *[.underline]##O##k* to confirm and record patient visits
* *[.underline]##C##ancel* to close the window and to return to the Menu

==== 5.2.3 Modify a recorded patient visit ([.underline]##E##dit)

First of all, to modify a visit you have to highlight it in the *_OPD Out Patient Department_* window. Once you’ve done this, press the *[.underline]##E##dit* button. When the *_Edit OPD registration_* window showed below appears, the record is available for changes. All data can be changed.

image:extracted-media/media/image12.png[image,width=373,height=414]

When you finish entering data in the *Buttons Panel* you have the following choices:

* *[.underline]##O##k* to confirm new values (all the previous values will be lost)
* *[.underline]##C##ancel* to close the window and to return to the *_OPD Out Patient Department_* window without applying any change.

==== 5.2.4 Delete a recorded patient visit ([.underline]##D##elete)

First of all, to delete a stored visit you have to highlight it in the *_OPD Out Patient Department_* window. Secondly press the *[.underline]##D##elete* button. The highlighted record will be showed as in the *_New Hospital_* window below. Now the record can be deleted. Deleted records won’t be available anymore.

image:extracted-media/media/image13.png[image,width=278,height=206]

In the *Buttons Panel* you have the following choices:

* *[.underline]##S##i* to confirm the record deletion

=== 5.3 OPD Extended (OPD v1.3)

Since OpenHospital version 1.3.1 you can extend the OPD functionality by changing the _OPDEXTENDED_ flag in the configuration file. Ask to your Administrator how to do it or read the _Administrator’s Guide_.

==== 5.3.1 New features

Press *[.underline]##N##ew* button in the *_OPD Out Patient Department_* window to access the *_New OPD registration (1.3)_* window showed below.

image:extracted-media/media/image14.png[Schermata%202018-01-18%20alle%2017.46.57.png,width=668,height=417]

The OPD Extended module affords the following improvements:

* Calendar to choose the visit date (1);
* OPD number now is visible (2):it is the progressive number per year automatically set by the system, anyway you may change it if needed. The OPD number MUST be unique for each year;
* Registered Patient (3): before to choose a disease, you MUST select a patient first from the drop-down list; you can even fast search the patient with the search field nearby by typing part of its name or code; this will improve reliability for reports and statistics, thus service to the patients by knowing his/her history.
* one time the patient is selected and previous OPD visit is found from the program, special fields will be populated with the most recent visit of the patient (4), thus his/her personal data (5), re-attendance checkbox will be selected automatically (6);
* in case you want to insert a new attendance for this patient you can check the "new attendance" check box on and proceed normally;
* in case of editing an old OPD it is possible to change everything except the patient, which the OPD refers to, and the "new-attendance" check box;
* in case the selected patient needs to update his/her personal data, you can do it by clicking on the Edit icon image:extracted-media/media/image15.png[edit_button.png,width=26,height=26] near his/her name; a new window will appear with the patient personal information to let you change them;
* in case the patient is not yet registered, the *_<new patient>_* entry can be selected to let you register the new patient; after registration you will be direct back to the OPD window and the new patient will be selected.
* If the user is enabled by the admin (see *_15._* *_Users & Groups_* ([.underline]#File# -> _[.underline]#Users#_)), you will see also the “Examination” button function (see *_10.5.2_* *Patient examination*)

=== 6.2 Pharmaceutical Stock (Pharmaceutical [.underline]##S##tock)

==== 6.2.1 Main Characteristics

The Pharmaceutical Stock feature helps you to store and trace every stock movement that has been made. Every movement is identified by the following data:

* date of the movement
* type of the movement, that is, if it’s a charging or discharging one
* the ward that the movement refers to. This characteristic is needed for discharging movements only. In fact, it’s important to know in which ward pharmaceuticals have been used, otherwise this field will appear empty
* the quantity
* the pharmaceutical (which in turn relates to different categories: Laboratory, Surgery, Drugs or Chemical)
* the lot which the movement is referred to. Actually, there are some pharmaceuticals that may not have a lot related (for example ‘Gloves’), so you can omit this field. But it’s recommended to store even the lot (if it exists), because every lot has its own peculiarity:
** a name (that can be its code)
** a preparation date
** a due date
+
In this way you can find which movement refers to the pharmaceuticals that are expiring, or pharmaceuticals prepared in a specific date, or how many movements have been registered about that lot, and so on.
* the supplier of the pharmaceutical. This characteristic is needed for charging movements only. This field will appear empty in other cases

==== 6.2.2 Functions of Pharmaceuticals Stock 

To access the functions of Pharmaceuticals, press *Pharmaceutical [.underline]##S##tock* on the Pharmacy menu showed below.

image:extracted-media/media/image22.png[image,width=220,height=182]

The window *_Stock movement browser_* showed below will be opened. All functions available under Pharmaceutical Stock are accessible from the *_Stock movement browser_* window.

image:extracted-media/media/image23.png[image,width=598,height=327]

The following functions are available from the *Buttons Panel* of the window *_Stock movement browser_:*

* *[.underline]##C##harge* you use it to record a new charge movement
* *[.underline]##D##ischarge* you use it to record a new discharge movement
* *[.underline]##E##xport to excel* to export pharmaceuticals stock movements

* *Stoc[.underline]##k## Card* to show the movements history for a certain pharmaceutical (can be directly selected by the list otherwise will be requested)

* *[.underline]##C##lose* button, to exit from the *_Stock Movement Browser_* window

As you can see, there’s no “Delete” button as you’re not allowed to delete a movement; but if a mistake occurs - for example you’ve inserted the wrong quantity of a pharmaceutical in charge – you must just insert the new movement to correct the mistake – a discharge movement in this example.

Furthermore, a search function (*[.underline]##F##ilter)* is available using the Selection panel on the left of the window.

===== 6.2.2.1 Search pharmaceuticals stock movements ([.underline]##F##ilter)

image:extracted-media/media/image24.png[image,width=169,height=507]

Using *_Stock Movement Browser_* search function, you can filter and show on the window useful information such as:

* how many boxes of pharmaceutical remains in the stock
* which movements have been made in a specific day
* in which ward a specific pharmaceutical has been discharged
* if there are any pharmaceutical expired

Queries about movements of pharmaceuticals can be done using the search criteria available on the *Selection panel* area of the *_Stock movement browser_* window (left side of the browser). Results of your search are showed on the *Data table* area.

The selection panel is used to select a group of movements according to specific filters. You set a filter using the tools contained in the selection panel.

Filters refer to three different objects: the *Pharmaceutical*, the *Movement*, and the *Lot preparation and Lot due date*.

As far as a *Pharmaceutical* is concerned, user can choose its:

* description, that is its name
* type: Laboratory, Surgery, Chemical and Drugs

In order to avoid conflicts, you can change one of these options only. So, when the description combo box is active, the other one is not, and vice versa.

As far as *Movement* are concerned, user can choose its:

* *_Type_*: it specifies if it’s a charge or a discharge one. If you select the discharge option, then the ward combo box gets enabled. The ward combo box allows you to find any discharging movements that refer to a specific ward.
* *_Date_*: you can choose a time frame between ‘Date from’ and ‘Data to’. The date tools consist of three blank areas, which (from left to right) refer to day, month and year. As you have inserted a value on a blank area, he can move to the next one by typing the “Tab” button on the keyboard. As the window is loaded, the date is set in such a way to cover the last week by default.

Finally, as far as *Lot preparation* and *Lot due date* you can search movements that refer to specific lots by inserting:

* the lot preparation date: you have to choose a valid time span (between ‘Preparation Date From’ and ‘Preparation Date To’)
* the due date; it behaves like the lot preparation tool and the movement date tool.

Each filter can be combined with another, allowing you to obtain many possibilities.

After have chosen, press *[.underline]##F##ilter* button. The system will show on the *Data table* area results of the search applying criteria requested by you.

image:extracted-media/media/image187.png[Login.PNG,width=305,height=148]

OpenHospital allows the management of users organized into groups; each group is characterized by different permissions assigned by the Administrator.

Before to register a new user in the system, we should ensure there is a group with its related rights, where the user can be added to.

The window shows the full set of function of OpenHospital in a tree format:

* main is the “trunk”: the main menu
* *Blue* nodes are the “branches”: menus and windows
* *Black* nodes are the “leaves”: buttons and functions

By double-clicking on each branch or leaves we can enable or disable that function or set of functions for the selected group.

For instance, the group “Registration Office” and the group “Cashiers” may have the following group permission configurations:

So, the Registration Office group can only use the Admission/Patient module to insert and edit patients, while the Cashiers group can only use the Accounting module in order to produce bills. Both can run HELP (this guide) and Communication module.

So, the “main menu” for each user registered in Registration Office group and for each one in Cashiers group will appears like following:
