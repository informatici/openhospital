# Portable Open Hospital

Open Hospital (https://www.open-hospital.org/en/) is a free and open source
software for healthcare data management. Its portable version (Portable Open
Hospital, POH) allows you to take along with you Open Hospital and run it on
any computer, keeping the data you have saved. With POH, we also hope to
reach the goal to make Open Hospital easily installable so that even somebody
with no experience of Java or MySQL can try or use it.

POH allows to use Open Hospital on a computer, easily move the installation on
another computer or even run it from a USB stick or drive.  All you have to do
is to copy the root installation directory of POH to your favourite path, the
program and the data will be kept.  POH uses its own version of the Java Virtual
Machine and the MySQL server and everything is contained in the root
installation directory.  POH is released under the GNU GPL 3.0 License.

The Linux version has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 x64 updated to October 2020.
The Windows version has been tested on Windows 10.
